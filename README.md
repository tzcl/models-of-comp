# Models of Computation
Programs developed over the course of learning about computation.

## Propositional logic
- `exp.hs`: Parses strings into propositional expressions
- `wang.hs`: Wang's algorithm for checking validity of a propositional formula
- `tsetyin.hs`: Tseytin transformation for converting a formula to CNF without exponential blowups

## DFA
- `dfa.hs`: Checks the validity of a given DFA
- `dfa-emulator.hs`: Steps through a DFA to determine if it will accept a given input

## Maths
- `matrix.hs`: Matrix operations
- `primes.hs`: Searching for primes
